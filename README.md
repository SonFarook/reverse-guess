# Reverse Guess – Binary Search Game

A fun number guessing game where the **computer tries to guess your number** using the Binary Search algorithm.  

This is my **first fully self-developed JavaScript project**. I built it to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and algorithmic thinking. For the design, I used **TailwindCSS** to keep it simple and responsive.
